## Welcome to the ProTrait website
The first proton therapy treatments took place in the Netherlands towards the end of 2017. Considering heterogeneous protocols and data analysis pipelines, it is of paramount importance to set up the proper infrastructure that can enable a harmonized data collection and analysis platform, including clinical comparisons with photon therapy. 
ProTRAIT aims to provide such an IT infrastructure based on the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 
The ProTRAIT infrastructure will make available prospective, standardized, multi-centric data from all Dutch proton and a representative group of photon therapy patients.
